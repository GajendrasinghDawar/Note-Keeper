# Note Taking App

This is a Progressive Web App (PWA) built with React. It provides offline capabilities and can be installed locally on your device. I am learning PWA patterns to make web apps feel more like native apps using only web tools. So, this app is a kind of playground for me to apply learned PWA concepts.

## Features

1. Offline support.
2. Installable on desktop and mobile devices.
3. Rich Text Editing support.
6. Responsive design.


## Used Technologies

- **ViteJs**: For bundling and static site generation.
- **Service Worker**: For caching assets on client side Offline Support.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling the application.
