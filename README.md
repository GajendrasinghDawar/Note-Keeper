# Note Taking App

This is a Progressive Web App (PWA) built with React. It provides offline capabilities and can be installed locally on your device. I am learning PWA patterns to make web apps feel more like native apps using only web tools. So, this app is a kind of playground for me to apply learned PWA concepts.

1. Offline support.
2. Installable on desktop and mobile devices.
